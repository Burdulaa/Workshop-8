# Workshop-8

This project is a multi-section website with multiple cards, built using HTML and CSS.

> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-8

## Overview

The goal of this workshop is to move from a single component or simple page to a more complete website that:

- Has multiple sections stacked vertically (e.g. hero, info, features/cards, footer)
- Uses reusable card components for content
- Separates browser reset styles and custom styles into different CSS files
- Stays fully static and runs only in the browser

## Features

- Main page: `index.html`
- CSS reset file: `reset.css` to normalise browser defaults
- Custom layout and styling in `style.css`
- Local image assets inside the `image/` folder (used in sections or cards)
- Multiple content sections on a single page
- Card components (for features, services, items, etc.)
- Pure front-end: HTML + CSS only (no JavaScript, no backend)

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with a reset stylesheet)
